# Snake-with-AI
Snake with an optional pathfinding AI.

About: This game is playable by both the user and the AI. The AI can be turned on or off at any time. The AI uses best first search, which is an entirely heuristic based pathfinding algorithm. It's similar to A*, but it doesn't take into account a nodes distance from the starting node as finding shortest paths isn't really what we're looking to do.

Run: Just follow the link in the about section.
